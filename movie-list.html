<h3> 
    <li>Interstellar</li>
</h3>
<p>My favorite sci-fi movie starring Matthew Mccounaghae. This story is about a farmer who is elected by NASA to find habitat on a new planet for man-kind. Little does he know that this adventure
    would turn into an experince that bends the rules of science and metaphysics.

<h3> 
    <li>The Harder They Fall</li>
</h3>
<p>This modern day black starred western produced by Jay Z is a sweet revenge story of an outlaw and his crew. 
    Through years of hunting and trials and tribulations, the crew stumbles upond the bounty of their dreams, but also
    a bounty of harsh truths and dark secerets.

<!--3rd movie on list-->

<h3> 
    <li>Kung Fu Panda Series</li>
</h3>
<p>When it comes to kids movies or animation, the Kung Fu Panda series falls second to none. The story is about a 
    wonky panda named Po who comes to find he is a warrior that was chosen to help protect the Earth. As each movie progresses, 
    Po comes to understand himself more and more, unlocking his hidden power within.
